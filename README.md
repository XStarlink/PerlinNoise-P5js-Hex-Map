# Hex Map

A useful terrain simulator based on hexagons that relies on Perlin noise for the height values. You can use this tool freely to generate your own maps or change the script to add new functionality.

If you're interested in running the code on your own, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) in order to run the .pyde file with the Python module.
